""" Design and implement an algorithm that is
given as input an integer value k â‰¥ 0 and a list
of k numbers N1, N2, . . ., Nk. Your algorithm
should reverse the order of the numbers in the
list. That is, if the original list contained:
N1 = 5, N2 = 13, N3 = 8, N4 = 27, N5 = 10
(k = 5)
then when your algorithm has completed, the
values stored in the list will be:
N1 = 10, N2 = 27, N3 = 8, N4 = 13, N5 = 5 """
